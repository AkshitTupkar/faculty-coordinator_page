        <h2>RNXG,</h2>
        <p>
            A favorite place for all robot enthusiasts of SGGSIE&T, Nanded. This place is not the usual technical club. Itâ€™s a place where dreams realize into reality, hard work blossoms into success, hardship shapes the life, co-working builds the discipline, and failures get transformed into a superb project. This 24 by 7 coworking place embraces students from all disciplines. We work in embedded systems, computer vision, robot motion planning, dynamics and controls, mobile robotics, assistive devices, IoT-based systems, and Artificial intelligence.
